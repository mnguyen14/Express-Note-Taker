## Description
This app allows you to take notes, save them, view them later, and delete them when you no longer need them.

## Installation
Run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once doing so you can run 'node server.js' and you will be prompted with a link in your terminal, 
http://localhost:3001. You can control + left mouse click or type the provided link into your URL bar to begin using the app.

However, installation is not necessary. You can follow the Heroku link provided above to use the app.

## Usage
Upon opening the page you will see a "Get Started" button.

Upon clicking it, you will be redirected to a page where you can begin note taking.

Initially you will see a placeholder title and body text. Upon typing a title and what notes to go into the body, a save icon that looks like a floppy disc will appear on the top left. You can click the save icon to save your notes, populating it on to the left hand side. You can click on the name of note titles on the left hand side to view previous notes. You can return to adding new notes by clicking on the plus icon on the top left. When you feel that you no longer need notes that you saved, you can delete whichever notes you want, including my preset instructions notes, by clicking the garbage icon.

Here is a video of me demoing the app:
